      <h1>Hi! I'm Ana Barua!</h1>
      I'm a FullStack Web Developer, and I'm actively looking for an exciting
      job where I can constantly learn new skills and grow as a professional.
      I'm interested on both Front and Back end and I'm open to teach myself any new
      technologies I might need to keep moving forward. I have experience in
      team work projects with technologies such as HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express,
      React, Redux, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, and MongoDb.

    </>
